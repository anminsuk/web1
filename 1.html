<p style="margin-top:20px">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>
